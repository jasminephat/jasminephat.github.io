			 <h4>Final Sketchbook Assignment</h4>
				 <p> As our final sketchbook project, we had to choose and create a concept of our choice and showcase it through our knowledge of graphic design programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop, Sketchbook, and Flash. My topic for this was the concept of "kimo-kawa", which is the Japanese term for creepy and cute. With this in mind, my intentions for my final piece was to create something that would be aesthetically appealing to the eye, yet inducing a sense of uneasiness from the viewer.</p>
