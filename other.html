			<h4>Europe Trip Adobe Voice Project</h4>
				<p>To extend our knowledge of Adobe programs, we were required to create a presentation using Adobe Voice, in order to promote SWCTA's annual trip to Europe over the summer. The program essentially reduced the normal work that would go into creating a video down to 5%.</p>

 			<h4>Narrative Presentation</h4>
 				<p>In AP Lang, we were put into partnerships and were provided the task of researching an essay mode that we were provided with. Alongside with research, we also had to create a presentation on that essay mode to inform the class on it. The assignment was very simplstic, as our mode was Narration.</p>

			<h4>Froot Review</h4>
				<p>As a two-year reviewer on the Southwest Shadow, I decided to review Froot, by Marina and the Diamonds. I was required to write an article every week on my opinion on various things in the media using the rules of journalism.</p>

			 <h4>Sophomore Chemistry Self-Experiment</h4>
				 <p>Aside from writing reviews, I am also able to write news stories on what goes around at school. During that week, sophomores in chemistry were undergoing a project in which they had to create their own experiment and have it successfully work. Essentially, news stores are a lot less tedious than the standard review, since stories require straight-forward information.</p>

 			 <h4>Rocky Horror Picture Show Review</h4>

				 <h4>Precis</h4>
					 <p>Alongside our Modes Project, we also had to practice writing precis', which are four sentenced, heavily structured summaries. Though a simple concept, grasping the true ideas of it was very challenging. To practice, we had to read passages out of the AP Lang textbook and write precis' on them. I tackled the challenge easily from the very start.</p>
