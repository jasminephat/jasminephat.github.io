			<h4>Dante's Inferno Website</h4>
				<p>A website designed for client Michael Moore, a 10th grade English teacher. The site was intended to inform students on the works of Dante Aligheri, along with his works, specifically his piece, "Dante's Inferno". This was our first client site, which helped us learn how to cater to a client's needs for a site.</p>

 			<h4>Southwest CTA Responsive Site</h4>
 				<p>This website was created in an attempt to revive Southwest Career and Technical Academy's website, which was claimed to be unresponsive and unorganized. As second year Web Development students, we faced the challenge and put our coding skills to the test. This website was moderately more challenging to code, considering that we often went our own ways, along with dealing with the requirement of having it all be responsive to different screen dimensions.</p>

			<h4>Hour of Code</h4>
				<p>Annually, the school holds the Hour of Code, which is an hour in the middle of the school day focused primarily on the virtues of coding. Through this, we had to instruct students at Fine Elementary school on coding through simplistic activities. The event took weeks of tedious planning but was overall a success and great learning experience.</p>

			 <h4>Hip Hop Meets IT</h4>
				 <p>For our Winter PBL, the Web program held a conference that focused on teaching the dance group, Culture Shock, the virtues of coding, while they taught us the virtues of dancing. The conference took many weeks of planning, but it was worth it in the end, as both parties went home with new knowledge.</p>

				<h4>Javascript Quiz</h4>
					<p> To search further parts of web design, we designed a quiz website using Javascript that would test users on various categories of web development.</p>
